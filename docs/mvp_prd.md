# Interactive Diagram Tool - MVP Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

### Problem Statement
Creating architectural and system diagrams requires balancing detail with visual clarity. Static diagrams either:
- Lack sufficient detail to be truly useful
- Become cluttered and overwhelming when they include comprehensive information
- Fail to show dynamic relationships and different operational scenarios

### Solution Vision
An interactive diagram tool where users can click on components to bring them into focus, revealing detailed interactions, relationships, and contextual information without cluttering the overall view.

### Target Users (MVP)
- **Primary**: Software architects and technical leads creating system architecture diagrams
- **Secondary**: Product managers and engineers who need to understand complex system relationships

## MVP Scope & Features

### Core Features (Must Have)

#### 1. Interactive Component Focus
- **Click-to-Focus**: Click any diagram component to bring it into visual focus
- **Relationship Highlighting**: Show all connections and data flows related to the focused component
- **Context Panel**: Display detailed information about the focused component in a side panel
- **Dim Non-Related**: Reduce opacity of unrelated components to minimize visual noise

#### 2. Dynamic Information Display
- **Multi-Level Detail**: Toggle between high-level overview and detailed component view
- **Contextual Information**: Show component descriptions, responsibilities, and technical details
- **Connection Metadata**: Display information about data flows, APIs, and relationships when hovering over connections

#### 3. Diagram Creation & Editing
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Add and position components easily
- **Connection Drawing**: Simple line/arrow drawing tool to connect components
- **Component Library**: Pre-built component templates (databases, services, APIs, etc.)
- **Basic Styling**: Color coding, shapes, and text formatting options

#### 4. Export & Sharing
- **Static Export**: Export current view as PNG/SVG for presentations
- **Interactive Share**: Generate shareable links for interactive viewing
- **Embed Code**: Provide embed code for documentation sites

### Enhanced Features (Nice to Have)

#### 1. Scenario Modes
- **Different Views**: Toggle between different operational scenarios (normal, high-load, failure states)
- **Flow Animation**: Animate data flows to show real-time system behavior
- **State Visualization**: Show component states under different conditions

#### 2. Collaboration Features
- **Comments**: Add contextual comments to components
- **Version History**: Track diagram changes over time
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple users editing simultaneously

#### 3. Advanced Interactions
- **Search & Filter**: Find specific components or filter by type/category
- **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate large, complex diagrams easily
- **Minimap**: Overview navigation for large diagrams

## User Stories

### Core User Journey
1. **As an architect**, I want to create a system diagram with multiple components so that I can document my system architecture
2. **As a viewer**, I want to click on any component to see its detailed information and relationships without losing the overall context
3. **As a team member**, I want to understand how a specific service interacts with other components by clicking on it and seeing highlighted connections
4. **As a presenter**, I want to export my interactive diagram as a static image for presentations while maintaining the ability to share the interactive version

### Detailed User Stories

#### Creation & Editing
- As a user, I want to drag components from a library onto the canvas
- As a user, I want to draw connections between components with labeled relationships
- As a user, I want to add descriptions and metadata to each component
- As a user, I want to organize components into logical layers or groups

#### Interaction & Focus
- As a user, I want to click on a component to see all its connections highlighted
- As a user, I want to see a detail panel with component information when focused
- As a user, I want other components to fade into the background when I focus on one
- As a user, I want to easily return to the full overview from any focused state

#### Sharing & Export
- As a user, I want to share a link that preserves the interactive functionality
- As a user, I want to export the current view as a high-quality image
- As a user, I want to embed the interactive diagram in documentation

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Technologies
- **Framework**: React/Vue.js for component-based UI
- **SVG Manipulation**: D3.js or similar for dynamic diagram rendering
- **Canvas/SVG**: SVG preferred for crisp scaling and easy interaction
- **State Management**: Redux/Vuex for managing diagram state and focus modes

### Core Technical Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet (mobile optional for MVP)
- **Performance**: Smooth interactions with diagrams up to 50+ components
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Data Format**: JSON-based diagram storage format

### MVP Technical Architecture
```
Frontend (SPA)
├── Diagram Canvas (SVG-based)
├── Component Library Panel
├── Property/Detail Panel
├── Toolbar (zoom, export, share)
└── State Management
Whole Web App should be wrapped under a docker

Backend (Optional for MVP)
├── Diagram Storage API
├── Share Link Generation
└── Static Export Service


```

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- **Primary**: Time spent interacting with diagrams (target: >2 minutes average)
- **Secondary**: Number of component clicks per session (target: >5 clicks)
- **Retention**: Users return to edit/view diagrams within 7 days (target: 40%)

### Feature Usage
- **Interactive Focus**: % of users who use click-to-focus feature (target: 80%)
- **Export/Share**: % of diagrams that are exported or shared (target: 60%)
- **Diagram Complexity**: Average number of components per diagram (target: 15+)

### Technical Performance
- **Load Time**: Initial diagram load under 2 seconds
- **Interaction Response**: Click-to-focus response under 200ms
- **Export Speed**: Static export generation under 5 seconds

## MVP Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Interaction (2-3 weeks)
- Basic drag-and-drop diagram creation
- Click-to-focus functionality
- Simple component library (5-10 basic shapes)
- Static export (PNG)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Details (2 weeks)
- Component metadata and detail panels
- Connection labeling and information
- Improved styling and visual hierarchy
- Shareable links

### Phase 3: Polish & Share (1-2 weeks)
- Export improvements (SVG, better quality)
- Embed functionality
- Basic responsive design
- Performance optimization

## Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)
- Scenario/mode switching
- Real-time collaboration
- Advanced component library
- Integration with documentation tools
- Mobile app
- AI-assisted diagram generation
- Import from existing tools (Visio, Lucidchart, etc.)

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Assumptions
- Users primarily work on desktop/laptop devices
- Diagrams will typically have 10-50 components (not massive enterprise diagrams)
- Users prefer web-based tools over desktop applications
- SVG-based rendering will provide sufficient performance

### Constraints
- MVP budget limits backend complexity (consider local storage first)
- Development team size affects timeline
- Must work reliably across different screen sizes
- Export quality must be presentation-ready

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Performance with large diagrams**: Implement virtual rendering and component limit warnings
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Test early and often on target browsers
- **SVG complexity**: Have Canvas fallback plan if SVG performance issues arise

### Product Risks
- **User adoption**: Conduct user testing with target personas early
- **Feature complexity**: Keep MVP focused on core interaction, resist feature creep
- **Export quality**: Prioritize high-quality static exports as they're often shared widely
