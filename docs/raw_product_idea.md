During drafting of an architectural diagram for my new product idea
I find it frustrating to ensure the diagram cover enough details while maintaining visual cleaniness without too much clutter
I think the best way should be making it interactive, and allow each component to be clicked and be the visual focus to show all of its complex interaction and relationships with other components and under different scenarios.
